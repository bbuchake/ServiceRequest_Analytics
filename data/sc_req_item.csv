Hi Janet,

Same issue with new RITM. Organization name is CAMPUS. 

We are going to close old RITM0129233 on behalf of RITM0129818

Subject: RE: Message from Rais Ahmed: RITM0129233 - Virtual Server Request Form

I'm pretty much sure I picked the ucsfmedicalcenter.org can't be campus. Not sure what happened. We need the server up asap because we have live date in a couple weeks so I submitted another request RITM0129818 to replace this one and this time I checked again and again it's ucsfmedicalcenter.org. I don't see the cancel option in RITM can you please cancel the RITM0129233 and work on the RITM0129818? Thank you.

Janet

The meeting would be to go over the workflow of what we would like the redcap account requests to be and to modify/automate some of it. How much of it can be performed in servicenow with existing functionality and how much we have to to develop.
 - enhancements would be to add user to an AD group on provisioning
 - change the current welcome email
 - add a de-provisioning step when the users attestation expires - remove users from a group
 - scripts - who develops etc

We would also like to find out if it's possible to create INC's based from an email in which users of our redcap system use to contact the administrators. This whole stream of work is currently not being captured by servicenow.

People from my team who would attend: Glenda Sharp, Remi Frazier.

Hi Jon,

we cannot submit server build request since organization is selected as CAMPUS. You would need to submit BU, FUND, Dept ID, Project ID on server Draft form.

Hi Rais,
Existing server MCNCRAWAP001 is 10.72.27.130 for the Mission Bay Responder 5 system.
Domain is ucsfmedicalcenter.org
Dept: App_Technology
please deploy in UCSF_P6_NTNX_CLINSYS cluster

I need a quote for the labor and any software licenses to do this.
The cluster belongs to my department, so we will quote the customer for the actual servers.
Once I get a quote, I can move it along and get you a PO or cost center for this.

Thank You,
Jon Palmer

Hi Jonathan,  
Please provide any existing server to provide same IP range to create these new servers, 
Please let us know which domain you want to create these servers, 
Also we cannot submit server build request since organization is selected as CAMPUS. You would need to submit BU, FUND, Dept ID, Project ID on server Draft form.

This is Kyle from IT service desk clinical support, I hope you are having a wonderful day so far.
 
We just received a call from Jaison, asking to put in an urgent ticket to request a time sensitive report. We managed to submit this RITM together and got the approval from Tom Poon. Would you look into it at your earliest convenience please? I believe Jaison will be sending you details search criteria separately.   

Let us know if there is anything else we can do at the service desk level.
 
Thanks mate!

Please assist in switching a telephone number between two telephones located at 3333 California St. Suite 335. The telephone number to be switched onto another physical telephone (located in 335F)  is: 

Celia Kaplan: 502-5601

So the end result would be that Celia Kaplan's id and number would be on the physical phone (located in 335F) and a new conference room id and number would be on Celia's old physical phone (located in 335J). For more guidance and on-site assistance, please call Andrew Rodriguez at 415-410-5239. 

Best,
Katie Mak

Hi Jann,Hope all is well! Ian would like to install a new server in the ECDC and could benefit from some 'PM assistance. This is a facilities-related application used as a UPS Monitoring Tool. He'll need a risk assessment completed as this system is net-new, and then an IP issued on an approved subnet. We have the server already but FW rules and other Network requirements are unknown.Could you please assist with first steps to get this request off the ground? any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.Matthew Almeida","2018-02-25 13:44:39","4 - Low"

•	We're being asked to build performance indicator reports on how well we build our research billing grids.  We'd like to explore pulling data from our OnCore CTMS as well as certain data fields within our servicenow tickets onto another reporting platform.  I'd like to explore whether that's feasible.

Request Details: 
   Requested By Date: 2018-02-12
   Overview/Business Requirement: For use with Salesforce Marketing Cloud:

University Development and Alumni relations is seeking to centralize our online email and social communications from Luminate Online (Convio), MailChimp, and iModules over to Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC). SFMC will allow UDAR and its campus partners to create a more dynamic email marketing experience for donors and give them more relevant content that they are interested in. 

We would like to implement SSO so that UCSF UDAR employees can access this new platform with their UCSF MyAccess credentials. Benefits include:
- Quicker user adoption of the tool so they aren't having to remember one more login.
- Easier user management from the product team. As employees leave UCSF their access to this resource is contingent on them having an active UCSF employee account.
   Intended Use: IDs are used solely for user account login access to SFMC
   Security: Non-UCSF Data Center
   Required Attributes: 
      UCSFID: unique identifier represents the shared identifier between the identity provider and the Marketing Cloud to validate access

I don't know what kind of pull you have with IT, but once again, it's not possible to connect via VPN to the network.  All efforts from this side, indicate that UCSF is blocking connection.  I don't know if this is true or not, but means that it's only possible to connect via UCSF email, which is cumbersome and makes it difficult to find files.  I am going to try to Skype the UCSF IT guys at the end of the day as well.

Request Details: 
   Overview/Business Requirement: Qualtrics wants us to update our SSO metadata. We are already using UCSF SSO. I am submitting a request per Nathan's instructions. 

https://ucsf.qualtrics.com


Hi Alex.

It looks like Qualtrics is changing their SAML entityID.  To our system, this would appear to be a completely new integration, even though it may be the same application.  You'll want to fill out and submit a MyAccess Integration Request.  That form is at

	https://ucsf.service-now.com/ess/myaccess_request.do

In the description of the application on that form, please specify the entityID of the current Qualtrics SAML integration.  If you don't know that, provide the URL used to initiate a SSO login and I should be able to find the entityID in our configuration.

Regards,
Nathan

Hi Nathan,
 
Do you have any advice on how best to coordinate the SSO changes with our vendor Qualtrics?
 
Thanks.

Alex, 

We'll need to have your team apply our new metadata to your system: 

https://co1.qualtrics.com/login/v1/sso/saml2/metadata

If your team uses InCommon all they will need to do is start sending your attributes to the entity ID: https://co1.qualtrics.com

If your team uses Okta, I will give them a different set of instructions.

We'll need to decide on a specific date & time to have your team make the changes on their end and for me to implement the necessary changes on our end. Then we'll have someone log into their account to make sure everything is working smoothly. 

Best,
Sam Schmitz

This tool rapidly queries our inpatient EPSI financial data and offers multiple protocols reflecting common financial and utilization questions. The target audience for this platform is frontline initiative owners, improvement specialists, analysts, and clinicians with an interest in understanding costs and how they relate to improvement proposals. Within Value Improvement, we've used the platform to pull historical service line data for the recent leadership report outs and vet Caring Wisely proposal financial projections. Physicians with access have also begun using the tool during clinical practice to assess the cost of drugs, lab tests, etc.

•	PHI: We may collect patient contact information such as email address/name for the nurse navigator to respond back to the patient.
•	Duration/Timeline: We have project grant support until August this year to build it out for further testing beyond August.

Question: Because Drupal dramatically limit the types of interactions that we would hope to build for this matching tool, we are wondering if you can walk us through the implications for us to create custom non-Drupal site and particularly regarding the following:
•	Risk management: acquiring, transferring and storing patient-related information
•	HIPAA compliance: web hosting via AWS or Azure
•	Cost implications

To support our needs for our mNGS assay, we maintain local servers that perform data analysis and host our own-developed web application (SURPIviz). Our sample throughput is steadily increasing, and our goal is to streamline our workflows for interpretation and resulting to scale up our capacity. We ultimately want to improve upon our current web application to create our own clinical reports (PDF) and deliver the reports (via fax to outside institutions and scan to APEX/SQ for UCSF patients). To achieve this we need to be able to host PHI on our servers.

Tuan Nguyen, from LIS, mentioned that we would be able to use a virtual server with the medical center. It would be nice to know what are our options are to host locally compared to hosting a virtual server with the medical center (also potential costs and risks related to each). Lastly, additional information about establishing an interface with APEX and/or Sunquest would also be beneficial for our goals.","2018-04-25 12:01:57","4 - Low"

However, UCSF is not the primary tenant in the space; it is leased by a private medical group. I believe we will be using the space one or two days a week. Our ideal set up would be to have UCSFwpa wifi that would be turned on only on the days where we use the clinic. I assume this would entail the wifi router having to plug into the private medical group's internet infrastructure over Ethernet. Then we would need a tunnel established to UCSF for that Ethernet connection. (see attached email thread)

I have questions,and at yesterday's meeting I was reminded that I do know someone to ask - you!

Over the years I've learned various, contradictory lessons about how our AV devices work best on various segments of the UCSF network. 

1)	In 2014 Mission Bay IT teams and I learned that the secure wireless roaming functionality provided by UCSFwpa cannot be made compatible with Bonjour, the service used by Apple TVs to broadcast their presence. Too bad, because lots of people were counting on Airplay at that time, and the AV vendor provided dozens and dozens of extra devices that were unusable. However, over the last 2 years I've noticed that APPLE TVs work just fine, no matter where I put em. How can I gain confidence that the network will continue to support these? 
2)	I remember this as well.  I think we can broach this topic with Manish Sompura and see what he says now vs back then.

2) Networked AV systems have been maturing for a few years now, and it's mighty tempting to use this technology - maybe in the MS-1112 room or maybe in the Clinical Sciences classrooms and conference rooms.  How I could make sure a networked AV system would live happily on the UCSF network ?

Here is an example:
https://www.crestron.com/Products/Featured-Solutions/DigitalMedia-NVX-Series
	For this I would also recommend we just model it out for Manish in terms of network requirements.  Can you put together a quick sketch of the user case and how much bandwidth it would require?  We can then have a conversation with Manish and inform him of the plan.

3) I've already deployed a few Dante systems - this is networked audio which uses less bandwidth than audio plus video, and supports non-critical functionality in my rooms. These designs use a small Cisco POE switch located in the AV Rack. I understand that this may be frowned upon, but I've never found it written down anywhere, and I've never been denied service or alerted by IT Security, so I'm getting more comfortable/reliant on throwing switches into the AV racks. 
Any thoughts?
	It is looking like all roads lead back to the network team and Manish specifically.  I've seen this setup in AV racks as well and I don't think it would be breaking any rules to do it.  I think we would just want to have the device registered.  Again another line item to review with Manish.

Let me know when you have the above info together and I can reach out to Manish and setup the conversation.


thanks for your  thoughts,

Henry Kyburg

Luci Frias gave me your name. I am working for ATOM which now rents space from BIohub in 499 Illinois on the 4th floor. We will be moving to the second floor sometime in July and will have to implement our own IT. We are looking for 5GBPS and I have quoted out Comcast. I want to find out how much it would cost for UCSF to install and maintain our IT system on the second floor.  Would I work with you for that? How do I proceed. Another option we are considering is whether we should coordinate with UCSF IT on the 6th floor (piggy back). UCSF will be our landlord starting in July (currently it is Biohub). Thanks for your insights.Cheers,Deirdre  https://atomscience.org/","2018-05-19 10:11:24","4 - Low"

If you can add 2350 Sutter, so that it shows up only for Safety Assessment, EHS7 Responder tickets. Assignment group: MCSS_Safety_Office_EHS7

2350 has limited support from MCSS, mainly follow ups through the Safety Office since it's a campus building.  No services from any other support service group represented on the MCSS menu page.

During our search, we met with Robin Healthcare who offers a virtual scribe solution. Their solution combines US-based virtual scribes with voice recognition and Artificial Intelligence. The latter 2 components are very important to us since we strongly believe that this is the direction that scribing is headed in. If successful, we can eventually eliminate the virtual scribe from the equation and have a completely AI/voice-recognition based solution to assist our physicians. This would significantly cut costs and could help the program offer the scribe resource on a larger scale.
 
Robin Healthcare supplies its clients with a cylindrical device that is placed into an exam room. The device, which has audio and visual capabilities, is able to document and perform various tasks based on the conversation in the exam room. An actual scribe will then log in remotely to review the note, make any edits, and submit directly into APeX. The physician will then have to sign into APeX, review the scribe's submission and sign the encounter.
 
According to Robin, they ""use 256-bit military-grade encryption"" and they assure their clients that ""all data is encrypted both at rest and in transit"" in a HIPAA compliant manner.","2018-06-21 08:11:48","4 - Low"

I'm requesting a VM named QCCREDWDB003 with 8 CPU, 48GB ram with a 32GB reservation, and 120gb of ""local"" disk for the OS drive, and at least a 10gb network connection. 

The database on QCCREDWDB002 is currently using approx 3.5TB of SAN storage and we would re-use this on QCCREDWDB003.
Can we transfer our existing SQL server license from QCCREDWDB002 to QCCREDWDB003? 

Added 05/30/2018: To be clear, do not disconnect the existing SAN storage on QCCREDWDB002. QCCREDWDB003 initially only requires 120gb of ""local"" disk for the OS and MS SQL Server installation. 

Edit 06/01/2018: Please add the following disks on SAN storage to QCCREDWDB003 when it is built
G:	1 TB		Database
H:	200 GB	Logs
I:	1 TB		stage/backups

My name is Miriam Muscarella and I am a 4th year medical student at UCSF.  I am working on a qualitative study involving interviews with past patients at UCSF's Center for Reproductive Health with Dr. Lauri Pasch (cc'ed) from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychology and Fellow Dr. Eleni Greenberg in OBGYN's REI division. 
We are interested in using Zoom to conduct our interviews and had a few questions with SOM Technology Services
First: what are the security needs in order to audio record (and store) conversations through Zoom? As investigators, we would of course have our computers encrypted, but what are the requirements for potential patient participants speaking from home? Does Zoom and Zoom storage of audio/video meet UCSF research requirements?
Second: we have already reached out to the Zoom representative at UCSF as well as the IRB office, and they suggested we reach out to IT Services to better understand the safety requirements for Zoom and its use for research.","2018-07-04 08:33:40","4 - Low"

Subject: GitHub at UCSF - CRT Proposal - Early Adopters Input/Support Needed
 
Hi All,
 
I am part of a cross-disciplinary group (CC-d) working on a proposal for the UCSF CRT (IT governance committee for research technology) to implement a central code sharing platform for UCSF teams that develop software code. Benefits of having a centrally managed platform include increased developer productivity, improved knowledge sharing, consistent code management process and minimized privacy and security risks.
 
Minimizing privacy and security risks associated with sharing code is a key requirement for campus-wide code sharing platform because the code written for biomedical applications may involve accessing and processing clinical data and other proprietary information. 
 
We are looking at GitHub as one of the best currently available solutions. Our top 2 implementation options include on-premise hosting and AWS-based hosting. 
 
We are asking you as the informatics/technology program leaders to support this proposal and help us present the business case with the 2 following steps:
1.	Confirm your program has a high priority need for secure code sharing platform and let us know how many of your team members would actively use it in the first 1-2 years.
2.	Consider sharing the implementation cost with the IT Governance CRT. Perhaps, splitting half of the deployment and first year administration cost among 3-4 early adopters would make this proposal more feasible for funding. We don't have  final cost estimates yet, but we will be able to share them in the next 2-3 weeks.
Please let us know your general thoughts on 1,2, by May 23, assuming the shared cost would be feasible for your budget. 
We are hoping to get this proposal on CRT agenda in June-July. 
 
Thank you!
Oksana

My free times are listed at www.doodle.com/stevenchanmd  -- feel free to propose a couple of times.

At the moment, AC3 (the APeX Clinical Content Committee) -- run by Kelsey Sobomehin, Andy Auerbach, and Kay Burke -- approves ""BestPractice Advisory"" alerts, but unified documentation does not exist for these items. ServiceNow currently contains tickets for only a portion of these alerts.

We were wondering if we can use ServiceNow such that a special type of ""ticket"" acts as this unified documentation ... perhaps similar to http://itsm.ucsf.edu/sites/itsm.ucsf.edu/files/qrc_-_knowledge_management.pdf (Knowledge Management).


We could set up ServiceNow so there are ""master tickets"" / ""master issues"" / ""parent tickets"". 1 Parent Ticket represents 1 BPA.

    RITM0012804 Master: BPA D-Dimer
    RITM00123554 Master: BPA Concierge Pop-up
    RITM012345 Master: BPA Palliative Care Screen

Then, any new requests, single incidents, build requests would be child tickets:

    RITM0012804 Master: BPA D-Dimer (open, because this is active)
        RITM213131 Child: Initial build (resolved)
        RITM213132 Child: Second update (resolved)
        RITM213133 Child: Active request (open ticket)
    RITM00123554 Master: BPA Concierge Pop-up
        ... etc...
    RITM012345 Master: BPA Palliative Care Screen
        ... etc...

Within each Master/Parent Ticket, we can post info like statistics, descriptions, etc. 


Please let me know how we can set this up!
